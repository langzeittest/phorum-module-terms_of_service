Installation:
------------

1. Unpack the archive.

2. Move the directory "terms_of_service" to the directory "mods" within your
   Phorum installation. Don't change the directory name!

3. Move terms-of-service.php to your phorum-directory. Rename the file if you
   want to use a localized file name (in this case you have to change later
   the file name also in the settings).

4. Move the terms_of_service.tpl to your template-directory. You'll find a
   appropriate file for the various templates in
   /mods/terms-of-service/templates/.

5. You will want to copy or edit lang/english.php in this mod's dir and alter
   the TOS to be legal and appropriate for your site.

6. To show a link to the TOS on the index page, edit header.tpl. Add the
   following line just before the closing "div id=user-info" tag:

{IF URL->TOS}<a class="icon exclamation" href="{URL->TOS}">{LANG->TOS->Header}</a>{/IF}

7. Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and go to the
   "Modules" section.

8. Enable the module "Terms of Service Module".

9. At the first time that this module is run (by visiting the forum), the
   module will automatically create a custom profiles field for storing the
   acceptance date of the TOS. You should be able to see the field in the
   admin interface under "Custom Profiles":

   Field name: mod_tos
   Field length: 8
   Disable HTML: yes


Module settings:
---------------

1. Date of last change to the Terms of Service

Set the date of the last change to the Terms of Service. This date is used to
force users to re-accept the Terms of Services after modifications. It's
recommended to use a date in the future.

The default value is the date of enabling the module.

2. Default value for the accept-checkbox

Define the default value for the accept-checkbox on the posting-form. If you
use "unchecked" the user have to mark the checkbox for each post.

The default value is "unchecked"

3. File name of the Terms of Service page

Change the file name if you want to use a localized name. Don't add the file
extension ".php". Take care that you have to change also the file name in the
file system!

The default value is "terms-of-service".


Language support:
----------------

This module supports multiple languages.

The following languages are included:

- English
- Estonian
- German (Sie)
- German (Du) male
- German (Du) female

If you want to translate the module to a new language, you'll have to do the
following:

Copy lang/english.php to lang/yourlang.php (yourlang.php must have the same
name as Phorum's main language file that you use). After this, translate the
strings in lang/yourlang.php.

If you have created a translation for this module, please post a zip file
containing lang/yourlang.php in the module thread at phorum.org, so the
translation can be added to the module package. See:

Sanity Checks:
-------------

If you have problems with this module login as administrator in Phorum's
administrative interface and go to the "System Sanity Checks" section. Check
for warnings or errors for the Terms of Service Module.


Todo:
----

- Extend sanity checks: Check if template file exists also in templates used by
  forum settings. For the moment it is only checked if the template exists in
  the default forum template.
- Use template file for extending register and posting page. For the moment the
  HTML code is included in terms_of_service.php.
